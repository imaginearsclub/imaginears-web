# Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

## Two-Factor Authentication & Connected Accounts

**Date:** October 2024  
**Status:** Production Ready üöÄ

---

## üéâ What's Been Implemented

### 1. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
‚úÖ **Complete and fully functional**

- Profile page setup with QR code generation
- TOTP verification (30-second codes)
- 8 single-use backup codes
- Enable/disable functionality with password verification
- Encrypted secret storage (AES-256-CBC)
- Hashed backup codes (SHA-256)
- Login flow integration with 2FA verification
- Support for any TOTP authenticator app

**Files:**
- `lib/two-factor.ts` - Core utilities
- `app/profile/components/TwoFactorSetup.tsx` - Profile UI
- `app/login/components/TwoFactorVerification.tsx` - Login UI
- `app/api/auth/check-2fa/route.ts` - Check if 2FA required
- `app/api/auth/verify-2fa/route.ts` - Verify and create session
- `docs/TWO_FACTOR_AUTH.md` - Complete documentation

### 2. Connected Accounts & Discord Linking
‚úÖ **Complete and fully functional**

- View all connected authentication methods
- Link Discord OAuth account
- Unlink accounts (with safety checks)
- Beautiful UI with status indicators
- Prevent unlinking last auth method

**Files:**
- `app/profile/components/ConnectedAccounts.tsx` - UI component
- `app/profile/page.tsx` - Server actions
- `docs/CONNECTED_ACCOUNTS.md` - Complete documentation

### 3. Multi-Login Support
‚úÖ **Users can login with:**

- Email + Password (with optional 2FA)
- Discord OAuth (uses Discord's security)
- Both linked to same account

---

## üîê Security Design (By Design)

### Email + Password Login
- ‚úÖ Requires our custom 2FA (if enabled)
- ‚úÖ TOTP codes or backup codes
- ‚úÖ Password + 2FA verification

### Discord OAuth Login
- ‚úÖ Uses Discord's authentication system
- ‚úÖ Discord has their own optional 2FA
- ‚úÖ No additional 2FA required (industry standard)

**This is intentional!** OAuth providers handle their own security. Discord's infrastructure is trusted just like Google, GitHub, and Microsoft OAuth.
