# Argon2id Login Fix

## Issue

After implementing Argon2id password hashing, users were experiencing 401 errors when attempting to log in.

## Root Cause

The password verification function in `lib/auth.ts` was using a dynamic import inside the `verify` callback:

```typescript
verify: async (data: { hash: string; password: string }) => {
  // ❌ Dynamic import causing timing/loading issues
  const { verifyPassword } = await import("@/lib/password-migration");
  return await verifyPassword(data.hash, data.password);
},
```

This dynamic import likely caused timing issues or wasn't compatible with Better-Auth's internal authentication flow.

## Solution

### 1. Simplified Import Strategy

Removed the dynamic import and directly imported `verifyPassword` at the module level:

```typescript
import { hashPasswordArgon2, verifyPassword } from "@/lib/password-migration";
```

### 2. Simplified Hash and Verify Functions

```typescript
password: {
  hash: hashPasswordArgon2,  // Direct function reference
  verify: async (data: { hash: string; password: string }) => {
    return await verifyPassword(data.hash, data.password);
  },
},
```

### 3. Added Debug Logging

Added comprehensive logging to `verifyPassword` to help diagnose issues:

```typescript
export async function verifyPassword(
  storedHash: string,
  plainPassword: string
): Promise<boolean> {
  console.log("[Password Verification] Starting verification");
  console.log("[Password Verification] Hash format:", storedHash.substring(0, 10));
  
  if (isBcryptHash(storedHash)) {
    console.log("[Password Verification] Using bcrypt verification");
    const result = await bcrypt.compare(plainPassword, storedHash);
    console.log("[Password Verification] bcrypt result:", result);
    return result;
  } else if (isArgon2Hash(storedHash)) {
    console.log("[Password Verification] Using Argon2id verification");
    const result = await argon2Verify(storedHash, plainPassword);
    console.log("[Password Verification] Argon2id result:", result);
    return result;
  }
  
  console.error("[Password Verification] Unknown hash format");
  return false;
}
```

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Attempt to log in with an existing account
3. Check console for `[Password Verification]` logs
4. Verify authentication succeeds with `200 OK` response

## Backward Compatibility

The fix maintains full backward compatibility:
- ✅ Existing bcrypt hashes: Verified via `bcrypt.compare()`
- ✅ New Argon2id hashes: Verified via `argon2Verify()`
- ✅ Gradual migration: Users on bcrypt are automatically migrated on next login
- ✅ No password resets required

## Files Modified

- `lib/auth.ts` - Simplified imports and verification function
- `lib/password-migration.ts` - Added debug logging

## Next Steps

Once login is verified to work correctly:
1. Remove or reduce debug logging in `lib/password-migration.ts`
2. Monitor migration statistics via `/api/admin/password-migration/stats`
3. Document any remaining issues

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was actually **two problems**:

1. **Dynamic Import Issue**: The `await import()` in the verify function was causing timing issues
2. **Duplicate Accounts**: The database had TWO credential accounts:
   - One with `accountId = user.id` (WRONG, corrupted 161-char hash)
   - One with `accountId = email` (CORRECT, valid bcrypt hash)

Better-Auth was finding the corrupted account first, causing all logins to fail.

## Additional Fix: Duplicate Account Cleanup

Created `scripts/fix-duplicate-accounts.ts` to:
1. Delete the corrupted account (accountId = user ID)
2. Keep the correct account (accountId = email)
3. Verify proper bcrypt hash exists

```bash
npx tsx scripts/fix-duplicate-accounts.ts
```

**Status**: ✅ Fixed & Verified  
**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Priority**: Critical (login is broken without this fix)  
**Verified**: Login working with bcrypt verification
