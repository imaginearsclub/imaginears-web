## 🎯 How It Works

### Create Role Form
When creating a new custom role:

1. **Navigate** to Admin → User Roles → Configure Roles
2. **Scroll** to Permissions section
3. **See** two new categories:
   - "Bulk Operations" with 6 checkboxes
   - "Session Management" with 7 checkboxes
4. **Check** category header to select all
5. **Check** individual permissions for granular control
6. **Create** role with selected permissions

### Edit Role Dialog
When editing an existing role:

1. **Click** "Edit" button on any role
2. **See** Permissions section with all categories
3. **New categories** appear with current selections
4. **Toggle** permissions as needed
5. **Save** changes

## 💡 Use Cases

### Example 1: Event Manager Role
```
Custom Role: "Event Manager"
Permissions:
✅ Events: all (4)
✅ Session Management: view_own, revoke_own (2)
❌ Bulk Operations: none
❌ Users: none

Result: Can manage events + own sessions only
```

### Example 2: User Support Role
```
Custom Role: "User Support"
Permissions:
✅ Users: read (1)
✅ Bulk Operations: bulk_reset_passwords, bulk_send_email (2)
✅ Session Management: view_all, revoke_any (2)
❌ Bulk Operations: bulk_change_roles (restricted)

Result: Can help users with passwords/emails, view sessions
```

### Example 3: Security Team Role
```
Custom Role: "Security Team"
Permissions:
✅ Session Management: all (7)
✅ Bulk Operations: bulk_suspend, bulk_activate (2)
✅ Users: read (1)
❌ Bulk Operations: bulk_change_roles (restricted)

Result: Full session control + limited bulk operations
```

## 🔍 Visual Features

### Category Checkboxes
- ✅ **Select All** - Click category name to toggle all
- 🔵 **Indeterminate** - Shows when some (not all) are selected
- ⬜ **None Selected** - Empty checkbox

### Individual Permission Checkboxes
- Each permission listed under category
- Shows permission action (e.g., "bulk_suspend")
- Click to toggle individual permission
- Disabled during form submission

### Permission Counter
- Shows "X selected" count
- Updates in real-time as you check/uncheck
- Helps track how many permissions you're granting

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### System Roles
- System roles (OWNER, ADMIN, etc.) can be edited
- Their default permissions already include new permissions
- Changes to system roles affect all users with that role

### Custom Roles
- New permissions available immediately
- No migration needed
- Can be added/removed freely

### Permission Inheritance
- No inheritance system (yet)
- Each role has explicit permissions only
- Must select each permission individually

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### TypeScript Types
Both components use the `Permission` type from `@/lib/rbac`:
```typescript
import type { Permission } from "@/lib/rbac";
```

This ensures type safety and autocomplete for all permissions.

### Data Structure
```typescript
const PERMISSION_CATEGORIES = {
  "Bulk Operations": [
    "users:bulk_operations",
    "users:bulk_suspend",
    // ...
  ],
  "Session Management": [
    "sessions:view_own",
    "sessions:view_all",
    // ...
  ],
  // ...
};
```

### Form Handling
- Permissions stored as Set<Permission>
- Converted to array for form submission
- JSON stringified for API transport
- Validated on backend

## 🎓 User Guide

### For Admins Creating Custom Roles

1. **Plan Your Role**
   - Decide what permissions are needed
   - Consider security implications
   - Start with minimum necessary permissions

2. **Use Categories Wisely**
   - Bulk Operations: Powerful, use carefully
   - Session Management: Consider privacy
   - Mix and match as needed

3. **Test The Role**
   - Assign to test account first
   - Verify permissions work as expected
   - Adjust as needed

4. **Document The Role**
   - Add clear description
   - Note what the role can/cannot do
   - Keep track of users assigned

### For Admins Editing System Roles

1. **Be Cautious**
   - System roles affect many users
   - Changes apply immediately
   - Consider impact before saving

2. **Common Adjustments**
   - Add session permissions to STAFF
   - Remove sensitive permissions from MODERATOR
   - Customize for your organization

3. **Backup Strategy**
   - Note current permissions before changes
   - Test on one role first
   - Can always restore from `lib/rbac.ts`

## 🚀 Next Steps

Now that the UI is updated, admins can:

1. ✅ Create custom roles with bulk operations
2. ✅ Create custom roles with session management
3. ✅ Edit existing roles to add new permissions
4. ✅ Fine-tune permissions for their organization
5. ✅ Delegate specific powers to custom roles

- ✅ Custom roles can access new features
- ✅ Better separation of duties

## ✅ Summary

- ✅ **Session Management** category with 7 permissions
- ✅ Visible in both Create and Edit forms
