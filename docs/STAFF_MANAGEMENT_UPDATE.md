### 2. Updated Role Management Section

**Old (Vague):**
```markdown
- **Owner**: Complete system control
- **Admin**: Full administrative access
- **Moderator**: Manage players and moderate content
- **Staff**: Basic staff member with limited permissions
```

**New (Specific):**
```markdown
- **👑 Owner**: Complete system control (all 35 permissions)
- **🛡️ Admin**: Full administrative access (34 permissions, cannot bulk change roles)
- **⚖️ Moderator**: Manage players and moderate content (13 permissions, read-mostly)
- **👔 Staff**: Basic staff member with limited permissions (9 permissions)
- **👤 User**: Regular user permissions (2 permissions, own data only)

See [RBAC System](../rbac-permissions/RBAC_SYSTEM.md) for complete permission breakdown.

Custom Roles: You can create custom roles with any combination of the 35 available permissions.
```

**Added:**
- Permission counts for each role
- Link to comprehensive RBAC documentation
- Note about custom role creation

---

### 3. Enhanced Security Considerations

**Old (Generic):**
```markdown
### Role-Based Access Control
- Only admins can access staff management page
- Role hierarchy prevents abuse
- Cannot delete last owner account
- Cannot delete your own account
```

**New (Specific):**
```markdown
### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The system implements **granular RBAC permissions**:

- **Page Access:** Requires `users:read` permission minimum
- **Create Operations:** Requires `users:create` permission
- **Update Operations:** Requires `users:update` permission  
- **Delete Operations:** Requires `users:delete` permission
- Role hierarchy prevents privilege abuse
- Cannot delete last owner account (system protection)
- Cannot delete yourself (even with permission)
- Custom roles supported - Grant specific permissions as needed

**Permission Enforcement:**
- ✅ Server-side validation on every request
- ✅ Type-safe with TypeScript
- ✅ Clear error messages (shows which permission missing)
- ✅ Audit logging enabled
- ✅ Fails closed (denies on error)
```

**Added:**
- Specific permission requirements per operation
- Permission enforcement details
- Link to Bulk User Management for advanced operations

---

**Moved from "Future" to "Recent Enhancements":**
- ✅ Two-factor authentication (2FA) - Already implemented!
- ✅ Bulk User Management - Already implemented!
