# ✅ LuckPerms Database Integration - COMPLETE

## Summary

Successfully implemented direct database access to the LuckPerms MySQL database, allowing real-time validation of Minecraft usernames when creating or updating staff accounts.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Connection (`lib/prisma-minecraft.ts`)
- ✅ Separate Prisma client for Minecraft database
- ✅ Connection testing and configuration validation
- ✅ Type exports for all LuckPerms models

### 2. Prisma Schema (`prisma/minecraft.prisma`)
- ✅ LuckPerms tables defined:
  - `LuckPermsPlayer` - Player UUIDs and usernames
  - `LuckPermsUserPermission` - User-specific permissions
  - `LuckPermsGroup` - Permission groups
  - `LuckPermsGroupPermission` - Group permissions
  - `LuckPermsAction` - Audit log
- ✅ Relations between players and permissions
- ✅ Custom output path for generated client

### 3. Utility Functions (`lib/luckperms.ts`)
- ✅ `validateMinecraftUsernameDb()` - Validate username exists in LuckPerms
- ✅ `getPlayerPermissionsDb()` - Get all permissions for a player
- ✅ `getPlayersInGroupDb()` - List players in a permission group
- ✅ `playerHasPermissionDb()` - Check if player has specific permission
- ✅ `getAllGroupsDb()` - List all LuckPerms groups with player counts
- ✅ `searchPlayersDb()` - Search players by username

### 4. Staff Management Integration
- ✅ Create staff form validates Minecraft usernames against LuckPerms DB
- ✅ Update staff form validates Minecraft usernames
- ✅ Error messages show specific validation failures

### 5. Testing & Documentation
- ✅ Test script (`test-luckperms.ts`) for manual verification
- ✅ Comprehensive setup documentation
- ✅ Quick start guide
- ✅ NPM scripts for Prisma management

## Usage Example

### Validating a Minecraft Username

```typescript
import { validateMinecraftUsernameDb } from "@/lib/luckperms";

const result = await validateMinecraftUsernameDb("Steve123");

if (result.valid) {
  console.log("✅ Valid player!");
  console.log("UUID:", result.uuid);
  console.log("Primary Group:", result.primaryGroup);
} else {
  console.log("❌ Invalid:", result.error);
}
```

### Getting Player Permissions

```typescript
import { getPlayerPermissionsDb } from "@/lib/luckperms";

const result = await getPlayerPermissionsDb("Steve123");

if (result.success && result.player) {
  console.log("Player:", result.player.username);
  console.log("UUID:", result.player.uuid);
  console.log("Groups:", result.groups);
  console.log("Permissions:", result.permissions);
}
```

### Searching for Players

```typescript
import { searchPlayersDb } from "@/lib/luckperms";

const result = await searchPlayersDb("steve");

if (result.success && result.players) {
  result.players.forEach(player => {
    console.log(`${player.username} (${player.primaryGroup})`);
  });
}
```

## Debugging

### Test the Connection
```bash
npm run test:luckperms
```

### Check Database Access
```bash
npm run prisma:minecraft:studio
```

### View Generated Client
The generated Prisma client is located at:
```
node_modules/.prisma/minecraft-client/
```

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

### Phase 1: Staff Dashboard
- [ ] Show Minecraft permissions for each staff member
- [ ] Display LuckPerms groups for staff
- [ ] Show last login time from LuckPerms audit log

### Phase 2: Permission Management
- [ ] Sync web app roles with LuckPerms groups
- [ ] Auto-grant permissions when staff is created
- [ ] Revoke permissions when staff is removed

### Phase 3: REST API Integration
- [ ] Transition from direct database to LuckPerms REST API
- [ ] Implement API key management
- [ ] Add permission modification endpoints

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] Player search with autocomplete
- [ ] Permission tree visualization
- [ ] Audit log viewer
- [ ] Bulk permission management

## Security Notes

- ✅ Database credentials stored in environment variables (not committed)
- ✅ Read-only queries only (no INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)
- ✅ Input validation on all user-provided data
- ✅ SQL injection prevention via Prisma ORM
- ✅ Admin-only access to staff management

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find package '@prisma/minecraft-client'"
**Solution:** Run `npm run prisma:minecraft:generate`

### "The column 'luckperms_groups.display_name' does not exist"
**Solution:** Run `npm run prisma:minecraft:db:pull` to sync schema, then `npm run prisma:minecraft:generate`

### "Unknown argument 'mode'"
**Solution:** This is a MySQL/PostgreSQL difference. The code has been updated to handle MySQL case-insensitivity properly.

### "Unknown field 'permissions' for include statement"
**Solution:** Ensure relations are defined in `prisma/minecraft.prisma`, then regenerate the client.

## Success! 🎉

Your staff management system now has full LuckPerms integration! Staff members can be linked to their Minecraft accounts with real-time validation.

**Test it yourself:**
1. Go to `/admin/staff`
2. Try creating a new staff member
3. Enter a Minecraft username that exists on your server
4. The system will validate it against LuckPerms!
